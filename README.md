# Terraform

This repository is my training ground for all things Terraform. Working with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is relatively new to me, so this repository will serve as a place for me to store some of the tools I'm using to learn in hopes of helping others. 

There are a few different folders listed within this repository for different environments. I'm trying to become proficient with cloud and on-premises infrastructure utilizing Terraform. Below is a list of folders we'll be working with to accomplish these learning adventures:

 - AWS
 - Azure
 - Cloudflare
 - GCP
 - Linode
 - VMware
